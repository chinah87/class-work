    "\n",
    "The **__init__()** method is a special method that Python runs automatically whenever we create a new instance in the **Dog** class. This method needs two leading underscores and two trailing underscores. This avoids Python confusing your method names with default method names. \n",
    "\n",
    "Here, the **__init__()** method has three parameters: self, name, and age. The first parameter in the method is absolutely required, and is used to pass the following parameters along. The first parameter is essentially referring to the instance itself. It gives the individual instance access to the attributes and methods in the class. \n",
    "\n",
    "Within the **__init__()** method we have two *attributes* - **self.name** and **self.age**. Here, we are basically taking the **value** \"name\" and storing it in the **variable** \"name\", and then attaching that variable to the **instance** \"self\". These attributes are available to any method in the class. These attributes are also available to any instance created from the class. \n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, the **Dog** class has two other methods - **sit()** and **roll_over()**. In each one, we don't need additional information like the name or age, so we just use the parameter \"self\". So, the instances we create later will have access to these methods now. \n",
    "\n",
    "For now, we aren't doing much with these methods...just printing that a dog is sitting or rolling over. But, if this class were part of a computer game, these methods could contain code that make an animated dog sit and roll over. If this class were written for a robot, the methods could direct movements that cause a dog robot to sit or roll over."

When Python reads this, it calls the **__init__()** method with these arguments 'willie' and 6. The method creates an instance representing this dog, and sets the attributes for name and age.

    "When you find that you're adding more and more detail to a class, you might consider breaking the large class into smaller classes that work together. \n",

    "Here, we can break off the detail about **ElectricCar's** battery into a separate class we'll name **Battery**. We define this new **Battery** class that doesn't inherit from any other class. We'll move the **describe_battery()** method into this class. \n",
    "\n",
    "Now, we can also add more detail to the battery, such as adding the **get_range()** method. This reports the range of the car based on its battery size. \n",
    "\n",
    "The **get_range()** method poses an interesting question - is the range of an electric car the propoerty of the battery or of the car? If we're only describing one car, then it's fine to associate **get_range()** with **Battery**. However, if we're describing a manufacturer's entire line of cars, we probably want to move **get_range()** to **ElectricCar**. The method would still check the battery size before determining range, but it would report a range specific to the kind of car it's associated with. Or, we could keep the method in **Battery**, but pass it a parameter such as **car_model**. The method would then report a range based on the battery size and the car model. \n",
    "\n",
    "So now, as your programming, begin thinking of the higher-logical level questions, rather than the syntax-level. There are no right or wrong approaches - you'll just figure out more efficient ways of doing things with experience. "
