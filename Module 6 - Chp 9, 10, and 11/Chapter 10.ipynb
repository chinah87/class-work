    "**Example 1** shows a program that opens the file, reads it, and prints the contents of the file to the scrren. To do anything with a file, you need to open it first with the **open()** function. The only argument needed is the name of the file. Python looks for this file in the same directory as the program is stored. The **open()** function returns an object representing the file, and Python stores it in **file_object**. \n",

You can also use the **close()** function to close the file, but problems could arise with that way...if a bug prevents your **close()** function from executing, the file may never close. Improperly closed files can cause data to be lost or corrupted. If you call **close()** too early, you might find yourself trying to work with a *closed* file (a file you can't access), which leads to more errors. Using **with** guarantees that Python will automatically close a file once it's no longer needed. \n",
